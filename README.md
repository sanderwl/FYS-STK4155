# Project 1 

In this project I aim to create the basic algorithms of a linear regression scheme. 

Exercises a-c aim to implement the OLS as well as the bootstrap and cross-validation resampling methods. Different number of bootstrap iterations and cross-validation fold size are tested and optimal values are found. 

Exercise d and e introduced shrinkage methods to compare to the OLS. The first shrinkage method is Ridge regression and with it I investigate the effects of the shrinkage parameter as function of model complexity and MSE. The same analysis is repeated for the Lasso regression scheme.

Lastly in exercise f and g, real data is introduced and we want to fit three models to predict this data using the 10-fold CV resampling method. One OLS, one Ridge and one Lasso model are fit using the optimal parameters found in the exercise. Then, the results are compared and conclusions about the three algorithms are drawn.
